# MLOps Example

Demonstration of how MLOps can be integrated into a typical Data Science workflow. The aim of this project is to implement the workflow described [here](https://github.blog/2020-06-17-using-github-actions-for-mlops-data-science/), gain hands on experience with the tools, and evaluate whether the workflow is feasible.
